## 🧭 Design Philosophy

I believe that **good design is invisible** — it quietly guides, communicates, and simplifies without drawing attention to itself.

My work is grounded in three principles:

1. **Empathy** — Understand users before solving their problems.
2. **Clarity** — Simplify complex systems into intuitive interactions.
3. **Feasibility** — Respect technical constraints to make design ideas real.
